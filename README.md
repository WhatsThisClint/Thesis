# Thesis

Hello! Thank you for reviewing my code.
Currently, the IGRAC's method and the one for Spain are complete. I have tested them with my dummy dataset.

IGRAC's Method is pretty straightforward and doesn't need any changes as it was crafted by IGRAC. However, the one for Spain and France can be reviewed.

The name of the dummy dataset is groundwater_timeseries_data_Negative.csv. The name is already loaded in the scripts.

You can find the methods in the methods folder along with the data files. 

The environment yml file also exists in the root folder.

Thanks again and have a great day :).
