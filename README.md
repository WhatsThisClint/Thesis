# Thesis

Hello! Thank you for reviewing my code.
The Currently the IGRAC's method and the one for Spain are complete. I have tested them with my dummy dataset. 
IGRAC's Method is pretty straughtforward and doesnt need any changes as it was crafted by IGRAC. However the one for Spain can be reviewed.
You can find the methods in the methods folder along with the datafiles. The environment yml file also exists in the root folder.

Thanks again and have a great day.
